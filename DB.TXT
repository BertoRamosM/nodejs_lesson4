we create the db with "CREATE DATABASE databasename"

then we use the database "USE databasename"

then we start migrating the json file into database 
table with "CREATE TABLE databasename"{

}

to create an id, similar to uuid, we use 
"id BINARY(16) PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT (UUID_TO_BIN(UUID()))"

to create the titles of the movies "title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL"

for the year "YEAR INT NOT NULL" etc

for text exists TEXT and VARCHAR, TEXT its used for larger amounts of string

DECIMAL(1, 1) in decimal we say how many numbers in each side of the "," we want in this case just one example: 4,5
